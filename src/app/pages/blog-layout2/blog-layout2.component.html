                  ine dining today is all too often synonymous with a sort of formality and sterility. Pristine white tablecloths, dim lighting, and black ties are ubiquitous – near compulsory, in fact. Front of house address you as “sir” or “madam”, and the food is to be experienced, but not necessarily enjoyed. Enrique Olvera’s Pujol is different; the sense of it is immediate. Situated in the Polanco neighbourhood of Mexico City, this internationally acclaimed restaurant is open and airy. There are no theatrics, and no shadowy exclusion from the bustling reality just outside its doors. When you’re in Pujol, you’re in Mexico, and you’re sure of it. Bossa nova plays from above, afternoon light dances along the walls, smoke from the wood burning oven permeates the air. Dressed in a black shirt with the top button undone, our server approaches with a smile. He’s warm and amiable, and lets us in on some of his favourite dishes from the day’s menu. It’s half past one, and the restaurant is buzzing. Patrons are chatting and laughing nearby, mezcal is being imbibed by the litre, everyone’s having a good time.

                  Lunch begins: Octopus with veracruzana sauce, wild mushroom soup, a pork chop paired with nixtamalised butternut squash, mole that’s been stewing for 1,478 days, a spiral churro. Each course is simple and straightforward, void of pretence and frills, yet throbbing with fiery, complex flavours. Everything feels somehow familiar. We’re enjoying the very best iterations of Mexican street food, once the exclusive preserve of the carts and stands strewn throughout the city. Yet, this time around, in lieu of streets and sidewalks, we’ve been summoned indoors to dine at the home of a local. Our host just happens to be Enrique Olvera. Speaking with the chef, I understand why Pujol whirs with vitality and joy. He’s humble, assiduous, and above all, happy. He tells me he’s just had an operation to remove a small tumour, and then, in the same breath, regales me with a funny story comparing LA traffic to Mexico City’s (conclusion: They both suck). When I ask him how he’s managed to hire and train such hospitable staff, he laughs: “Everyone here’s naturally like that. I don’t want to sound pretentious, but hopefully, it’s just a reflection of who we are as Mexican people.” Looking around the dining room, I see that after nearly 18 years since the restaurant first opened its doors, Pujol remains steadfast as Enrique Olvera’s love letter to his country, his people, and Mexico City.

                When the epicentre of international gastronomy shifted north, introducing the world to new Nordic cuisine, the assembled technocrats of Molecular Gastronomy from Spain to Chicago were left blinking in the dust. One of the key driving forces behind this movement is the Nordic Food Lab in Copenhagen. Founded in 2008 by Noma head chef René Redzepi and entrepreneur Claus Meyer, the non profit, self governed organisation explores the building blocks of Nordic cuisine through research into traditional and modern food production and preparation.

                Housed in an unassuming houseboat anchored on a canal opposite Noma, this is where chemists, chefs, scientists, anthropologists and academics work together to push the boundaries of new Nordic cuisine and share their findings with the world through various platforms.

                We met Michael Bom Frøst, the laboratory’s director and associate professor of Sensory Science at the University of Copenhagen; Josh Evans, correspondent of the Yale Sustainable Food Project; and Ben Reade, who has accepted the mantle of Head of Culinary Research and Development this past summer from Lars Williams, who now heads up the Noma test kitchen.

                Inside the lab, it’s bright and open, and the large industrial kitchen kitted out with gadgets. Prints of various roots and vegetables complete with their Latin names grace the walls, and sticky yellow notes litter the windows. Rows and rows of glass jars and plastic containers are filled with samples, some of them in various stages of fermentation. We arrive on the same day as a delivery of plums destined to help Ben create his own version of umeboshi.
